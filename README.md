# Architecture Document: Fraud Detection and Prevention System

## Project Overview

The Fraud Detection and Prevention System aims to enhance the security of financial transactions by implementing advanced algorithms to detect and mitigate fraudulent activities in real-time. This document outlines the architectural design and components of the system using AWS services.

### Objectives

* Implement robust fraud detection algorithms.
* Integrate seamlessly with existing financial services.
* Provide real-time alerts and notifications for detected fraud incidents.

### Scope

This document covers the architecture, components, interactions, and deployment considerations of the Fraud Detection and Prevention System within a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).

### Components

#### AWS Cognito
* Description: Manages user authentication, authorization, and profile management.
* Purpose: Secure access to the system using user credentials and tokens.

#### API Gateway
* Description: Serves as the entry point for all client requests and routes them to appropriate services.
* Purpose: Centralized management of API requests, including rate limiting and monitoring.
  
#### User Service
* Description: Manages user-related functionalities including profile management.
* Technology: Implemented using AWS Lambda functions and data stored in Amazon DynamoDB.

#### Transaction Service
* Description: Handles transaction-related operations and records transactions.
* Technology: AWS Lambda for business logic, Amazon RDS for transaction records.

#### Fraud Detection Service
* Description: Analyzes transaction data using machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent patterns.
* Technology: AWS SageMaker for machine learning models and real-time analysis.

#### Alerting Service
* Description: Sends alerts and notifications to users and administrators when potential fraud is detected.
* Technology: AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) and AWS SES (Simple Email Service).

### Interactions

* AWS Cognito: Provides authentication tokens (JWT) for secure access to other services.
* API Gateway: Routes requests from the User Interface to various backend services.
* Transaction Service: Records transaction data and sends it to the Fraud Detection Service.
* Fraud Detection Service: Analyzes transaction patterns and flags suspicious activities.
* Alerting Service: Receives alerts from the Fraud Detection Service and notifies users/administrators.

## 2. Technology Stack
#### AWS Services
* User Authentication: AWS Cognito
* API Management: AWS API Gateway
* Serverless Compute: AWS Lambda
* Database: Amazon RDS (for transactional data), Amazon DynamoDB (for user profiles)
* Machine Learning: AWS SageMaker
* Notifications: AWS SNS, AWS SES

## 3. Security
#### Authentication
* User Service: AWS Cognito for secure authentication and authorization.
* Data Encryption: TLS for secure data transmission.
* Access Control: AWS IAM roles and policies for service permissions.
